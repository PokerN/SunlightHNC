## General purpose hypernetted chain (HNC) integral equation code

Features:

* FORTRAN 90 based, with example python driver scripts ;
* fast Ng solver, and Ng decomposition for electrostatics ;
* multicomponent (up to three components) ;
* hard and soft core (DPD) potentials ;
* full structural thermodynamics.

See documentation for details.

You are of course welcome to use and modify this code for your own
projects. If you end up publishing results based on this code, or a
derived version, please cite :
